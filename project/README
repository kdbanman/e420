Steps to deploy to the cluster and run are simple:

1. SSH into any e5-05 machine as user ece420g2.
   Change to project directory.

  $ ssh ece420g2@e5-05-03.ece.ualberta.ca
  $ cd e420/project

2. Make a random hostfile.
   NUM_HOSTS optional, default is 5.

  $ make hostfile NUM_HOSTS=15

3. Pull and compile source on each host.
   PASS is ece420g2 password. (required)
   SIZE is passed to datatrim. (optional, default 10000)

  $ PASS=***** make hosts SIZE=20000

4. Make the cluster go!

  $ make run_mpi

Output from each host is stored in out.log.* files.
