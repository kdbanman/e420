The scripts for Lab2. Here is a list for all the files:

datagen.c	*code to generate the input data
Lab2IO		functions for loading and saving data
serialtester.c	*code to check the result
timer.h		macro definition to mesure the time

Note that you don't have to use the scripts without a "*". If you use your own IO functions, please make sure that the result is stored in proper format.
